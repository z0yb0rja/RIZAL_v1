# VALID8 Development Progress Tracker

This document provides an objective summary of the implementation status for the VALID8 platform.

## Implemented (Verified)
*   **Infrastructure**: Fully dockerized stack including FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, and pgAdmin.
*   **Authentication Core**: OAuth2 standard with JWT, bcrypt hashing, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Verification logic is complete; includes a development mock for console-based code retrieval.
*   **Database Schema**: Alembic migrations and core data seeding (Admin, Student, Roles) are functional.
*   **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: School-level data segregation and branding support are active.
*   **Audit Logging**: The backend logging framework for system and school actions is implemented.

## Incomplete / Under Development
*   **Frontend UI / UX**: 
    *   *Issue*: Login button remains active during MFA triggers, leading to duplicate requests.
    *   *Requirement*: Implementation of button-locking and loading indicators.
*   **Import Center**: Bulk student import functionality is implemented but requires stress-testing with production-scale datasets.
*   **Face Recognition**: Underlying models (dlib/face_recognition) are integrated; the end-to-end registration flow requires final verification.
*   **Notification Center**: Email and logging channels are active; SMS functionality is currently in placeholder status.
*   **Testing Automation**: Base model and API tests are present; a comprehensive end-to-end integration script is pending.

## Planned Roadmap
*   **Frontend Stability**: Implementation of request guards and UI feedback for authentication actions.
*   **Automated Integration Script**: Creation of a platform-wide test script to verify core login and security flows.
*   **Scanner Interface**: End-to-end implementation of the camera/scan module for real-time attendance tracking.
*   **Reporting Module**: Finalization of PDF/Excel export functionalities for event attendance.
