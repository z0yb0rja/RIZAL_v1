# VALID8 System Test Plan

This document outlines the required verification tests for the VALID8 platform and the number of successful attempts needed to consider each feature "stable."

## 0. Stability Criteria (Acceptance Thresholds)
- Manual attempts: 100% pass required; any critical error is a fail.
- Automated iterations: >= 98% success rate; no critical errors.
- Error cases: 100% must return expected status codes and messages.
- Multi-tenant isolation: 0 cross-tenant data leaks in 200+ attempts.
- Latency targets (p95/p99):
Auth/profile endpoints: p95 <= 500 ms, p99 <= 1,000 ms.
Event/attendance endpoints: p95 <= 800 ms, p99 <= 1,500 ms.
Bulk import per 1,000 rows: <= 20 s; error report <= 5 s after completion.
Export generation for 10,000 rows: <= 30 s.
- Adjust targets based on deployment scale and infrastructure.

| **Biometric Registration** | 3 | 50+ | Duplicate face data. |
| **Profile Updates** | 3 | 50+ | Duplicate email in profile. |

## 3. School and Multi-Tenancy

| **Tenant Isolation Check** | 5 | 200+ | Cross-school data access attempts. |
| **Subscription Limit Check** | 3 | 50+ | Exceeding user limits. |

## 4. Import Center

| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Bulk Student Import** | 3 | 20+ | Malformed file, duplicate IDs. |
| **Import Error Reporting** | 3 | 20+ | Checking error log accuracy. |
| **Retry Failed Rows** | 3 | 20+ | Invalid retry data. |

## 5. Event and Attendance Operations
| Feature to Test | Manual Attempts | Automated Iterations | Error Cases to Test |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Event Creation** | 3 | 100+ | Overlapping events. |
| **Face Recognition Log** | 5 | 500+ | Mocking face matches via API. |
| **Attendance Override** | 3 | 50+ | Unauthorized override attempts. |
| **Attendance Export** | 3 | 20+ | Exporting while data is moving. |

## 6. System Infrastructure & Governance
| Feature to Test | Successful Attempts | Error Cases to Test |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Audit Log Generation** | 3 | Performing an action and verifying it appears in the log. |
| **Notification Delivery** | 3 | Sending notification with no recipient email. |

## 7. Automated Test Logging
To keep data clean across different table structures, automated results will be saved into 4 distinct files:

1.  **Group A (Core API)**: `cmpj/logs_core_api.psv`
2.  **Group B (Security)**: `cmpj/logs_security.psv`
3.  **Group C (Bulk Specs)**: `cmpj/logs_bulk_ops.psv`
4.  **Group D (Biometrics)**: `cmpj/logs_biometrics.psv`

*   **Format**: **PSV (Pipe-Separated Values)**.
*   **Spreadsheet Compatibility**: YES. You can import `.psv` files into **Microsoft Excel** and **Google Sheets** by clicking "Import" or "Open" and selecting "Other" or "Custom" for the delimiter, then typing the pipe symbol `|`.
